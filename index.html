        <h2>About This Dish</h2>
        <p>This is a quick and impressive pasta you can whip up from scratch if you have a couple of hours, and a bag of spinach. The spinach gives new herby and earthy flavors to the pasta noodles, which can add an extra dimension to a dish. It also requires little in the way of special equipment since the whole recipe can be done with a blender, a bowl, and a rolling pin. 
        </p>
        <p>Once you’ve made the fresh pasta I would recommend using it immediately. However, it can keep in the refrigerator for up to three days, just be sure to dust it with plenty of flour. It can also be kept in the freezer for 3-4 months. Just be sure to increase the cook time from less than three minutes to around 4-5. Enjoy!
