          <h2>About This Page</h2>
          <p>
            Hey! My name is Shan and I'm a student at PCC in Portland Oregon.
            This page was built as practice for combining basic HTML pages and
            CSS stylesheets. If you go read through it you'll also learn a bit
            about me, as well as places I would like to someday visit.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of my main hobbies is cooking and baking, and a lot of the
            places I would like to visit reflect that. There are so many amazing
            cuisines and local specialties out in the world. Ideally I would
            like to try them all and see the world in the process. We'll get to
            that in a moment though, I do also have some non-food based hobbies
            you can check out below!

          <h2>Top Food Vacation</h2>
          <p>
            One place I would love to travel to for the food is Italy. I know
            that France is generally held up as the some of the best food you
            can have in europe, and don't get me wrong it is, Italy is where all
            many of my favorite dishes come from. This summer I got really into
            making my own tortellini and serving it with fried sage from my
            backyard. I would also love to know more about wood fired pizza
            techniques, all the different kinds of olive oil and how best to use
            them, and really how to make any kind of italian street food.
          </p>

            those can be found
