          <h2>Hokkaido Japan</h2>
          <p>
            Hokkaido is a small island off the coast of northern Japan. It's
            known around the world as a winter wonderland with an amazing ski
            and snowboard season. However, it is also famous for its food,
            including but not limited to, it's hearty hotpots and spicy curry.
            Personally I would love to try a local barbeque dish called "Gengis
            Khan" that uses lamb and vegetables. Lamb is not a popular source of
            protein in Japan outside of Hokkaido, so you just know it's gotta be
            good!

          <h2>Greece</h2>
          <p>
            In case it's not already abundantly clear I love most cuisines that
            use olive oil as a backbone. That being the case it should come as
            no surprise that Greece is very fight up on my list of places to
            travel. I'm especially fascinated with finding out good ways to
            prepare lamb and goat meat. Both are pretty uncommon proteins in the
            states, so getting the chance to try more dishes with them would be
            invaluable.

          <h2>Kerala India</h2>
          <p>
            Kerala is a southern state in India and a huge producer of spices.
            By some estimates India accounts for 75% of the worlds spice
            production. In Kerala you can see entire courtyards filled with
            Black Peppercorn, or Cinnamon, drying in the sun, waiting to be
            shipped. It's the kind of thing that makes me wonder what the air
            must smell like there. I'll bet it's unbelievable.
